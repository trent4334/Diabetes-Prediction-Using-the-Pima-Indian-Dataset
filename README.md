# Diabetes Prediction Using the Pima Indian Dataset  
### A Comparative Analysis of Logistic Regression, OLS, and Decision Trees

## üìã Project Overview

This project explores various statistical and machine learning models to predict diabetes outcomes using the **Pima Indian Diabetes dataset**. The primary goal is to identify which physiological features most influence the likelihood of diabetes and to compare model performance for clinical risk prediction.

> Originally completed as a class project by Trent Yu and Izabella Orozco.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methods Used

1. **Logistic Regression**  
   - Estimated odds ratios for key features  
   - Glucose had the highest influence on predicted probability  
   - Interpretable and widely used in clinical settings

2. **Multiple Linear Regression (OLS)**  
   - Used to understand linear relationships and contribution of features  
   - Identified Glucose, Pregnancies, and BMI as statistically significant predictors

3. **Decision Tree & Random Forest**  
   - Non-linear modeling with automatic feature selection  
   - Glucose identified as the root node in decision tree  
   - Accuracy improved through pruning and ensemble averaging

## üìà Results Summary

| Model                  | Accuracy | Precision | Notable Insight            |
|------------------------|----------|-----------|----------------------------|
| Logistic Regression    | ~0.746   | ~0.695    | Glucose strongly predictive |
| OLS Regression         | N/A      | N/A       | Glucose & BMI are key      |
| Random Forest (after tuning) | ~0.76    | N/A       | Root node = Glucose         |

- Glucose was consistently the **most impactful predictor** across all models.
- Pairplots revealed moderate linear correlation between Glucose and Outcome.
